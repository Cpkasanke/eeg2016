  answer is 45324*** This is before it is converted from a Fake Fasta format into a Real Fasta format. 
  After I convert it into Real Fasta format it unsorts my sequences and gives me a answer of 97930*** 
  I don't understand how its not just doubled; suddenly theres an extra 7K unique lines after i convert it into a real Fasta...
