# 1. Go to your home directory (/home/yourname).
cd

# 2. Make a new directory called 'exercise1'.
mkdir exercise1

# 3. Go to new directory.
cd exercise1

# 4. Download the file 'ex1.txt' from Github using the following command:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rec3141/eeg2016/master/exercise1/ex1.txt

# 5. Preview the file 'ex1.txt'.
head ex1.txt

# 6. Count the number of lines in 'ex1.txt'.
wc -l ex1.txt

# 7. Sort 'ex1.txt' by sequence identifier and save the output to a new file	   # called 'seqs.sort.fa'.
sort -n ex1.txt > seqs.sort.fa

# 8. The syntax to read 'file.txt' line by line and do something with each line is # shown below. This example echoes (prints out) each line, followed by a blank    # line, and appends each to a file called 'newfile.txt':
#    while read myline; do
#       echo $myline >> newfile.txt
#       echo "" >> newfile.txt
#    done < file.txt

# Use the construction above to output each line of 'seqs.sort.fa' two times, with # each line separated by a blank line, and save everything to a new file called   # 'seqs.dup.fa'.
while read myline; do
	echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
done < seqs.sort.fa

# 9. Output the non-blank lines from 'seqs.dup.fa' and dereplicate them into a new file called 'seqs.uniq.fa'.
