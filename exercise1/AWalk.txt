#The syntax to read file.txt line by line and do something with each line is shown below. 
#This example echoes (prints out) each line, followed by a blank line, and appends each to a file called newfile.txt:
while read myline; do
  echo $myline >> newfile.txt
  echo "" >> newfile.txt
done < file.txt
#The code above took the ex1.txt file and put spaces "" between each line
# while = loop
#read = Read a line from standard input
#myline = name of your variable to run in loop
#newfile = output file
#file.txt = file to be modified
# >> append 
#"" = space

##8
#Use the construction above to output each line of seqs.sort.fa two times, 
#with each line separated by a blank line, and save everything to a new file called seqs.dup.fa.
while read myline; do
  echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa

#Output the non-blank lines from seqs.dup.fa and dereplicate them into a new file called seqs.uniq.fa
grep '[^[:blank:]]' < seqs.dup.fa | sort -u  > seqs.uniq.fa
# grep '[^[:blank:]]' < seqs.dup.fa = looking for and removing blanks from dup file
# | sort -u = while sorting for unique identifiers and putting them into new file

#Count the number of unique DNA sequences in the file seqs.uniq.fa and
#output the value to a file in your home directory called ex1-answer.txt
wc -l seqs.uniq.fa  > ex1-answer.txt
